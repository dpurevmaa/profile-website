          <h2>Seattle University '20, BS in Computer Science</h2>

          <p>I am a new graduate student from Seattle University. I have experienced in developing a mobile application through the capstone project "Thump." Thanks to the power of teammates, I was able to show our application demo even during a global pandemic. 2020 has been hard for me as I struggled to finish my degree. However, it also showed me that there are endless possibilities I could do with my degree and knowledge in CS as long as I have the right determination and good motivation. I will not say I am creative, but I am enthusiastic about being creative by seeking things that yet to exist in the world. </p>

            <h3>Project "Thump"</h3>
            <p>In this project (Thump), we developed an idea of conveying one's feelings through in other forms using wearable items. In other words, it is an attempt to simulate a physical interaction to enhance the experience of using virtual communication.</p>
